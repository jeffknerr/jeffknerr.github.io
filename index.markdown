# Jeff Knerr's page...

I'm trying to write up some of the stuff I've learned, so I don't forget
it, or can easily find it again, or so others can find it.

I've benefitted greatly from others putting their solutions on the net. 
This is my attempt at giving something back. I hope my notes and scripts 
help you. Let me know if you have questions.

WARNING: Everything here is *use-at-your-own-risk*! If you use something of 
mine and it kills your machine, it's not my fault. 
*I'm not responsible, and I can't be trusted*.
